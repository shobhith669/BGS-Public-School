It occupies a prominent place in the 60 acres of BGS Health and Education City campus on Uttarahalli Road, away from the hustle and the bustle of the city but also among the parent community of West and South Bangalore. The school has an excellent infrastructure with spacious and well-ventilated classrooms, pure drinking water facility, library, state of the art computer labs, the laboratories for different disciplines of Science and a beautiful playground.

            The school is headed by a very highly qualified and experienced Principal who has the support of a team of dedicated, enthusiastic teachers who leave no stone unturned to help the children in their care.
